# Project Template

Edit this fill replacing the (items in parens) below. This acts as a *de facto* pre-registration.

1. **Title and author(s).** (Be specific. Even if you're unsure about the idea at this point; you can always update after consultation. If there are multiple contributors, consider specifying the [CRediT](https://casrai.org/credit/) taxonomy, as well.)
2. **Summary of research questions or hypothesis.** (What are you wanting to discover? If you're exploring, what are you exploring? What do you expect to happen or to find?)
3. **Motivation.** (Provide some context for the previous statement. Why do you want to know? Be specific.)
4. **Data.** (How are you going to answer your question or explore your hypothesis? Are you using a dataset? If so, link to it here. Are you doing a literature review? State your criteria for selection. Are you exploring an experience or concept? State how you'll take notes and gather information, for example your own actions or the observation/interviewing of others?)
	1. **Have you begun gathering data?** (Yes or No.)
	2. **If yes, have you looked at the gathered data?** (Yes or No.)
5. **Methods.** (On the heels of the previous item, what will your research method be? You may need to work with your faculty sponsor and/or the lab director on this.)
6. **Plan.** (Using the project timelines provided in the lab manual, describe your proposed process and plan to accomplish your project. Try to list the steps of your plan using SMART goals.)
7. **Leveraging the lab.** (How, specifically do you want to leverage the resources provided by the lab? Do you need time with some equipment, access to the space, research support from the lab personnel? If you need something specific, list this here.)
